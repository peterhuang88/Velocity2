# VELOCITY
## Submission for Los Altos Hacks high school hackathon

Velocity is a simple android lock screen replacement/overlay featuring a todo list, clock, inspirational quote, and a beautiful wallpaper. The quote and wallpaper are randomized upon screen-on. Velocity is inspired by the "Momentum" Chrome extension.

We aimed to achieve something like Momentum, but without the mass of a laptop, hence Velocity. (hahaha....)
